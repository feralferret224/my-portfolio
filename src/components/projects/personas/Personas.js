                        <p>For this project, my goal was to develop a better understanding of user behavior, and to gain experience analyzing behavior. In order to do so, I observed user interactions with the ordering kiosk of my local boba shop, Tiger Sugar.</p>

                            avoiding lines, and it displays photos of all the menu offerings, which the typical menu does not. The typical steps for ordering are
                            select a drink from the home page, customize the drink in the ordering page, select "checkout," enter your phone number for rewards and 
                            order updates, and complete the order by paying and adding a tip.

                <h5 class="mt-4">Key findings:</h5>
                        <p>
                            I found that users of the Tiger Sugar ordering kiosk typically began the process in one of two ways: by <b>scrolling</b> through the homepage to
                            the category of drink they wanted, or by <b>searching</b> for their desired drink using the search bar. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Users who had a <b>regular order</b> at Tiger Sugar typically spent <b>less time</b> on the homepage
                            and moved on to the ordering page more quickly, whereas <b>new users</b> who were unfamiliar with the ordering process took <b>more time</b> on the home page looking at drink options.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Regular kiosk users</b> were also more inclined to <b>opt into</b> the Tiger Sugar rewards program, and they believed it added value. The <b>new users</b> instead saw
                            the rewards screen as <b>not valuable.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Both new and returning users</b> felt lke there were <b>more steps than necessary.</b> Returning users felt that there were more steps required to use
                            the kiosk rather than simply asking ther cashier for their order, and they didn't having to enter their phone number in. New users thought the rewards
                            screen was an unnecessary extra step.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Returning users</b> felt that the customizations offered on the customization page were <b>not always consitent with their typical order</b>, and that some of the customization options
                            were contradictory or confusing. New users typically did not make as much use of the customization page (beyond allergen requirements) because they were less familiar with the drink they were ordering.
                        </p>

                                    and because there are photos of the drinks on the kiosk and not on the menu behind the cashier. She takes her time and scrolls through the home page, which lists 
                                    different drinks, and is overwhelmed by the diffent options. She does not select customizations for her drink because she doesn't have preferences yet.

                                        the interface. He does appreciate the ability to collect reward points on the kiosk, which is not available at the cashier.

                        <p>I got insight into the importance of user testing during this project. Different users found different things confusing. This was empowering knowledge because it enabled me to better put myself in their place, and I was better able to create the Empathy Maps and Storyboards.

                            Both new and returning users felt lke there were more steps than necessary. Returning users felt that there were more steps required to use
                            the kiosk rather than simply asking ther cashier for their order, and they didn't having to enter their phone number in. New users thought the rewards
                            screen was an unnecessary extra step.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Returning users felt that the customizations offered on the customization page were not always consitent with their typical order, and that some of the customization options
                            were contradictory or confusing. New users typically did not make as much use of the customization page (beyond allergen requirements) because they were less familiar with the drink they were ordering.

                                    and because there are photos of the drinks on the kiosk and not on the menu behind the cashier. She takes her time and scrolls through the home page, which lists 
                                    different drinks, and is overwhelmed by the diffent options. She does not select customizations for her drink because she doesn't have preferences yet.

                                        the interface. He does appreciate the ability to collect reward points on the kiosk, which is not available at the cashier.
